# Unit 12: Employee Tracker

Employee Tracker was created with Javascript, Node Js, Mysql, and Inquirer. When run in the command-line, the user is prompt with a message "What would you like to do?" with a series of choices. The user then can Add: departments, roles, employees; View: departments, roles, employees; and update employee roles.

### Prerequisites

From repository, (https://github.com/itsmedexter/unit12_Employee_Tracker), download cms.js, employeeSchema.sql, package-lock.json. Use Command-line or Terminal, go to the directory where you downloaded the files to. In the command line, type "npm install -y", this looks at the package-lock.json  and install the correct packages to run this program. After the installation, in the command line, make sure you are still in the same directory where "cms.js" is located, type "node cms.js". This should run the program and give you a prompt on what to do.
